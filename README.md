# Interactive Data Viewer

## Description  
This repository includes the files required for the week4's assignment of the data product course (from the data science specialisation on Coursera). The shiny application is an interactive graphic interface that allows the user to browse through some of the "classic" datasets seen during the course through a two dimensional plot. A regression analysis is displayed as well.
